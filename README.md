# Mini Data Analysis

## By Graeme Kempf

### Description
This repository contains two project milestones (mini-project-1 and mini-project-2) that together form an analysis for a cancer dataset. Each milestone is uploaded as an RMD file and an MD file. While this README file is the only explanatory document in the repository, each file contains sufficient description and comments so that they can easily be understood and explored.

### How to engage with this repository?
To access and interact with the code, the RMD files can be downloaded and opened in R or RStudio. To run properly, some R packages (i.e., datateachr, tidyverse, broom) must be downloaded. Otherwise, no other work is needed for them to be executed.
